# Coding Challenge
This repository is set-up mainly to share my problem solving skill, as a part to be highlighted on my [portfolio](https://jacksonkonjengbam.000webhostapp.com/ "Jackson K Portfolio") and understand the basic of github. If anyone is interested in any of the code in this repository then they can download, use and make changes to the code according to their own needs.

## Coding language
I am trying to solve the challenge in multiple programming languages and scripting languages but currently I will be solving the coding challenge in only four languages, namely:
- C
- C++
- JavaScript
- Python
- Php
